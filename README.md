Programming exercises from the book.


Project 8.1

Start from tree.java

modify to create a binary tree from a string of letters

Each letter will be displayed in its own node.

All nodes that contain letters are leaves.

Parent nodes can contain some non-letter symbol, i.e. +

Every parent has two children

Unbalanced tree is ok

No search - no quick way to find a given node


//Possibly make an array of trees (aka forest)
